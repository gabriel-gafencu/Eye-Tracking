#### metoda_empirica.cpp ####

Uses an empiric method in order to detect both the eye area and the pupil, based on a few simple observations made around the structure of the eyes (such as eye shape and color).

To test your own photos, insert them in the input folder as 'x.jpg' where x is any integer number. 
Then from the source file, modify the starting_image and number_of_images variables to only loop through that single photo.

The program also allows for debugging, showing snippets of the process or timing the algorithm. 
(Currently, the whole process takes around 2.25 seconds on average with the data from the 'input' folder. This might change with higher/lower res. photos)
